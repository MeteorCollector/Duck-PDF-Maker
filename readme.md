# Duck PDF Maker

I'm tired of searching online pdf editing platforms and being annoyed by their free-use limitations. I think simple task like these could be easily done from stratch, especially assisted by LLMs like ChatGPT. In fact, much of the code in this project is mainly generated by ChatGPT, and I appreciates it for saving my time.

## Use

```shell
python main.py
```

## Functions

- Convert PDF to seperate images

- Convert images to a single PDF

- Split a PDF file to single-paged PDF files

- Merge several PDF files into one PDF file

These tasks are rather basic, if you have more requests or suggestions, please take a issue. Bug shooting is also highly appreciated. Moreover, the UI of this software is too ugly now, I'll improve them later.

## Notice

DO NOT PROVIDE THIS SOFTWARE FOR A FEE TO OTHERS, THESE PDF TASKS ARE NOT WORTHWHILE TO BE CHARGED FOR.
